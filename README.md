## Overview of `Free-Bathroom-App`

### User Story
Jenny is a party animal who especially loves raves. The best part about raves is that they are virtually open until 8am. Jenny decided to leave a rave at about 5am in Bushwick New York, she got a few stops away before realizing she had to pee...immediately. She gets off any walks to the nearest establishment only to be told she must be a paying customer to use their restroom. She wishes there was an app that could tell her where the nearest free bathroom was!

## Project Details

### Necessary features

A basic implementation of this project must include:

1. Jenny can type an address into the search and see markers of nearby restrooms
2. Jenny can click on the marker to see details on the clicked location such as store name, rating, comments, location in the building
3. If Jenny comes across a bathroom near the city she can submit it through the app

###  Advanced features

Going above and beyond the basic implementation is very desirable, should you
have the time.

1. The address autocompletes when Jenny is typing in the search
2. Jenny wants her latest search to autofill the map when she click "recent search"
3. See preview of information when marker is clicked
4. Get directions to location
